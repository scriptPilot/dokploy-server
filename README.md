# Dokploy Server

üë®‚Äçüíª Best practice and helper to setup and maintain a [Dokploy Server](https://dokploy.com/).

## Setup

1. Create a server with IP4, for example with [Hetzner](https://console.hetzner.cloud/), for less than 5‚Ç¨ per month.

3. Configure the server:

    Connect via SSH, change the initial password and remember the new one:

    ```bash
    ssh root@{server_ip}
    ```

    Install Dokploy:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Exit the SSH connection:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

    Open the Dokploy app, create a user and remember the password.

4. Configure Dokploy:

   Notifications

   - At the domain hoster, create an email account for `dokploy@{domain.tld}`.
   - In Dokploy, use this SMTP account to configure email notifications for all events.

   Web Server

   - At the domain hoster, create a DNS A record for `dokploy.{domain.tld}` and forward it to the `{server_ip}`.
   - In Dokploy, use this domain and the  email account for the Web Server and Let's Encrypt, activate HTTPS.

   Git

   - Connect to GitHub by creating a dedicated application like `Dokploy Server @ Hetzner` and grant access rights to it.

4. Transfer all projects to the new server:

   - Configure the project and related services.
   - Update the DNS A record with the new IP.
   - Test the app with `http` and `https`.
   - Test the app with and without `www`.

## Backup

1. Clone this repository and open it in the code editor.

2. Create an `.env` file, containing the server ip:

    ```env
    DOKPLOY_SERVER=1.2.3.4
    ````

3. Establish a passwordless SSH connection:

    Generate a key pair:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Dokploy" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dokploy -N ""
    ```

    Copy the public key to the server, enter the server password:

    ```bash
    export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) && \
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dokploy.pub root@$DOKPLOY_SERVER
    ```

    Add the private key to the SSH agent for passwordless login:
    ```bash
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dokploy
    ```

4. Backup the Dokploy folder and all Docker volumes locally:

   ```bash
   bash dokploy-backup.sh
   ```
